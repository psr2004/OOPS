        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It allows developers to model real-world entities using classes (blueprints) and objects (instances), and emphasizes principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism for reusable and modular code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "* A class in OOP is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods) that the created objects will have, serving as the foundation for instantiating multiple objects with similar characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "* An object in OOP is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with state and behavior defined by its class, and each object can have different values for the attributes defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "* Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features to the user, while encapsulation is the technique of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "* Dunder methods, short for \"double underscore\" methods, are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __len__) and are used to define the behavior of objects in certain operations like initialization, printing, and arithmetic.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "* Inheritance is a feature of OOP where a class (child or subclass) inherits attributes and methods from another class (parent or superclass), allowing for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "* Polymorphism is the ability of different classes to respond to the same method name in different ways, allowing functions to use entities of different types at different times while maintaining a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "* Encapsulation in Python is achieved by defining class variables and methods and restricting access to them using access modifiers like single underscore (_) for protected and double underscore (__) for private members.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "* A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__ that is automatically invoked when an object of a class is created, and it is used to initialize the attributes of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "* Class methods in Python are methods that operate on the class itself rather than instances and are defined using the @classmethod decorator with cls as the first parameter, while static methods use the @staticmethod decorator and do not access instance or class-specific data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "* Method overloading in Python refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different numbers or types of parameters; although Python doesn't support it directly, it can be mimicked using default arguments or variable arguments (*args, **kwargs).\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "* Method overriding in OOP is when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass, allowing the subclass to modify or extend the behavior of that method.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "* The @property decorator in Python is used to create getter methods for class attributes, allowing attributes to be accessed like regular variables while still enabling encapsulation through method definitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "* Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, making code more flexible, extensible, and easier to maintain by enabling the same interface to operate on different data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "* An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and often contains one or more abstract methods (methods without implementation), which must be implemented by subclasses, and is typically defined using the abc module and the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "* The advantages of OOP include improved code reusability through inheritance, better data security through encapsulation, real-world modeling via abstraction, and greater flexibility and maintainability through polymorphism and modular design.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "* A class variable is shared across all instances of a class and is defined within the class but outside any methods, while an instance variable is unique to each object and is defined inside methods using self.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "* Multiple inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, enabling the subclass to access attributes and methods from multiple base classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "* The __str__ method returns a human-readable string representation of an object used by print() and str(), whereas __repr__ returns an unambiguous string representation used primarily for debugging and by repr().\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "* The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent or superclass, especially in inheritance, allowing access to the parent classâ€™s implementation without explicitly naming it.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "* The __del__ method in Python is a special method called when an object is about to be destroyed, typically used to perform cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources before the object is deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "* A @staticmethod does not take any implicit first argument and behaves like a regular function inside a class, while a @classmethod takes the class as the first argument (cls) and can access or modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "* Polymorphism in Python with inheritance works by allowing subclasses to define their own versions of methods inherited from a superclass, and when those methods are called using a superclass reference, the subclass version is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "* Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line, each method returning self to allow the next method to be called.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "* The __call__ method in Python allows an object to be called like a function; by defining this method in a class, instances of the class can behave like callable functions.\n"
